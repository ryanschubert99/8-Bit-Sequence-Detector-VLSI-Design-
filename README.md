# 8-Bit-Sequence-Detector-VLSI-Design-
This report displays the creation and validation of CMOS layout, and schematic 
designs for an 8-bit sequence detector. The design incorporated D-FFs, CMOS Logic 
Circuits, and a 4-Input AND Gate. The Design was created in Electric VLSI, and 
simulated using LTSpice software. Utilizing a 0.5-micron technology on the C5 process 
and following MOSIS design rules. Simulations in LTSpice confirm the expected logic 
behavior, validating the effectiveness of the CMOS layout design process
